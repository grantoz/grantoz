- 👋 Hi, I’m @grantoz
- 👀 Professionally, I’m interested in event-driven architectures, domain-driven design, microservices, personally: anything with a piano keyboard or synth engine attached.
- 📆 Lately I do a lot of Typescript web things - please see my LinkedIn
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deno and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I do enough tech at work. Drop me a line if you need an experienced keyboard player for your production or gigs in Sydney!
- 📫 How to reach me: @grantozolins on Twitter, see other links in Profile.
